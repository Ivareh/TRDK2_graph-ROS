# Documentation of the excel parser a prototype.

The customer wanted a prototype to show a method for how to parse through different data sets that where in different excel files. The reason for this was that the customer did not have to manually add the data they had stored into the mentioned excel files. This parser is meant to show a method to parse through the excel files provided by the customer. Due to time constraints and data files that could have been organized better, the group made this prototype to give an guidelines for a solution to this problem. This parser has several challenges that needs to be adressed in one way or another. These challenges will also be adressed in this documentation. In this documentation the group will go through the parser in detail, from the programming language and any convention used. At the end any challenges the group faced will be adressed.
